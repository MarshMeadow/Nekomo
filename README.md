Nekomo & Coming Back Stronger!! A fork of Kuro No & Shiro. Just another gogoscraper, and allanime scrapper, based on the shiro source code..

Dev info: The OG Dev is being quiet, and is no longer doing anything, and the app is being buggy, so I wanna take it in my own hands! 

Idk when or if I will do this, I may not get started on this for a while, or may just give up..

Give me ideas to rebrand, new app name and logo! Please üôèü•∫
